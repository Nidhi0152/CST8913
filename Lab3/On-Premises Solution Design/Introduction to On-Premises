### Introduction: On-Premises IT Infrastructure in a Mid-Sized Retail Company

On-premises refers to IT infrastructure, hardware, and software applications that are hosted on-site within a company's physical premises. This contrasts with cloud-based IT assets, which are hosted by public cloud platforms or remote data centers. One of the main advantages of on-premises solutions is the level of control they provide businesses, allowing them to directly manage the performance, security, and maintenance of their IT assets, along with the physical location of the infrastructure.

Many businesses, particularly those with legacy systems, continue to operate traditional data center resources on-premises. However, in recent years, there has been a significant shift toward migrating IT assets to the cloud, driven by the need for scalability, cost-effectiveness, and flexibility. Some organizations are also adopting hybrid environments, which combine both on-premises and cloud-based solutions, to maintain the benefits of local control while leveraging cloud services for certain workloads.

For a mid-sized retail company, their current on-premises solution includes a monolithic web application, an SQL database, local file storage, and email servicesâ€”all managed on physical hardware within the company's data center. While this traditional setup allows for full control over the infrastructure, it also requires significant maintenance and may limit scalability.

As businesses increasingly explore cloud adoption, it becomes essential to evaluate which components of the on-premises infrastructure are suitable for migration to cloud-based services. This evaluation involves determining which services are best suited for Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), while considering factors like performance, security, compliance, and business-specific needs. By migrating appropriate components to the cloud, the company can achieve greater flexibility and scalability while still maintaining control over critical aspects of its infrastructure.
