                                           Migration Strategy
To ensure a successful transition from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud, each component of the existing architecture must be carefully evaluated to determine the most suitable cloud service model: Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).

1 Web Application:
•	PaaS: The recommended service for the web application is Azure App Service, which allows the company to focus on application development while Azure handles infrastructure management, scaling, and updates.

2 Backend Database 
•	IaaS: For businesses requiring more control over database configurations, Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) running SQL Server can host the database, providing a lift-and-shift migration approach.

3 File Storage 
•	PaaS: Azure Blob Storage is ideal for storing unstructured data, including files, images, and backups. It is highly scalable, secure, and offers low-cost storage options. It’s a perfect replacement for the company's on-premises file storage system.

4 Networking 
•	Azure Virtual Network (VNet): This service allows the company to create a private network in Azure, securely connecting its resources in the cloud, similar to an on-premises network.

•	Azure Firewall: Azure’s cloud-native firewall service provides stateful packet inspection, intrusion detection, and prevention, and helps maintain security for the entire cloud infrastructure.

•	Azure VPN Gateway: For secure communication between the on-premises network and Azure, the company can implement a VPN Gateway, ensuring secure data transfer across hybrid environments.

5 Email Services 
•	Saas: Microsoft 365 (Exchange Online): For client email notifications, Exchange Online is a fully managed SaaS service that provides reliable, secure, and scalable email services. It integrates seamlessly with other Microsoft tools such as Office 365, SharePoint, and Teams, and eliminates the need to manage on-premises email servers.
