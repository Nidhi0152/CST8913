As businesses increasingly look to modernize their IT infrastructure, migrating from on-premises solutions to the cloud is becoming an essential step in improving scalability, cost-efficiency, and flexibility. This migration involves transitioning various components of an existing on-premises architecture to cloud-based services, which offer a range of deployment models such as Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).

The migration strategy for a mid-sized retail company, currently using a traditional on-premises setup, must be carefully planned and executed. The company operates a monolithic web application, a backend SQL database, local file storage, and uses email services for client notifications. The migration plan will assess each of these components and propose the best cloud service model for each.

Given the complexity and potential risks associated with cloud migrations, the strategy should also consider a hybrid approach. This approach allows for flexibility, with some components (like the web application) migrating to PaaS for ease of management and scaling, while others (like the database) might initially remain on IaaS to retain more control.

The migration strategy should outline the most suitable cloud services for each component, taking into account business requirements such as security, scalability, cost, and performance. The migration steps will include various techniques such as:

Rehosting (Lift and Shift): Moving applications and services to the cloud with minimal changes, ideal for quick migrations.
Refactoring: Rebuilding or modifying applications to take full advantage of cloud-native services, which may be required for achieving optimal performance in the cloud.
Replatforming: Moving to the cloud with some optimizations but without a complete rebuild.
Repurchasing: Replacing legacy on-premises services with SaaS solutions, often providing better functionality and management.
