 Purpose of the Lab
The purpose of this lab is to provide a comprehensive understanding of cloud migration and adoption strategies, focusing on the different service models available in the cloud: Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Through a comparative study of these services across various cloud providers, this lab explores how to evaluate and design solutions for transitioning from traditional on-premises infrastructure to the cloud.
This lab emphasizes the importance of selecting the appropriate service model for each component of an existing on-premises system and developing effective migration strategies to ensure a seamless transition to the cloud. The goal is to understand how cloud services can be applied in real-world scenarios, considering both technical and business factors.
By analyzing cloud architectures and exploring different migration approaches, participants will gain valuable insight into the process of moving to the cloud, helping organizations modernize IT infrastructure and fully leverage cloud technologies.
