# Tagging Strategy for Azure Resources

Tags are essential for organizing and managing resources in Azure. The following tags will be applied to resources to help categorize and allocate costs effectively.

### 1. Environment Tag:
- **Key**: Environment
- **Value**: Test
  
  The `Environment` tag is used to identify the environment in which the resource is deployed. It helps to distinguish between different types of environments such as **Test**, **Production**, and **Development**.

### 2. Department Tag:
- **Key**: Department
- **Value**: IT
  
  The `Department` tag will specify the department responsible for the resource. This helps track which department is utilizing or owning the resource, and is useful for **cost allocation**.

## Benefits of Tags
- **Cost Management**: Tags enable better tracking of costs and usage by categorizing resources based on specific attributes like environment or department.
- **Resource Management**: Tags help identify, organize, and manage resources easily, especially in large environments.
- **Automation**: Tags can be used in automation scripts to apply specific actions on resources with certain tags.
