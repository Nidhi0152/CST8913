Scenario: The following application consists of a Web Server written in Flask. A UI front end written in React. A database layer consisting of Postgres.

1) Describe how this application can be deployed in the cloud using IaaS infrastructure.
   IaaS infrastructure let you have full command over the infrastructure of your application and one can configure whole system according to their requirements. Cloud provider will only provide resouce needed and 
   client will pay as they use these resources.
   To deploy this application using IaaS will be consist of several steps:
   
   1)Set up a Virtual Machine (VM):
    In this case, youâ€™ll create virtual machines on the cloud. Your React Frontend, Postgres Database, and Flask Web Server will all be run on these virtual appliances.
   
   2)Configuration for software needed:
     Once you got the virtual machines, you need to install the relevant software. This entails:Flask for the backend (web server),React for the front end (UI),Postgres for the database system.

   3)Networking and Security :
    You will need to coordinate communications among these systems so that users can access the frontend and the web server can link to the database. Furthermore, you will have to impose firewalls, security groups, 
    and ensure that only the correct individual can reach the servers.

   4)Managing and monitoring:
    You will be in charge of keeping the servers running properly. It involves keeping an eye on performance, guarantee enough space, and addressing issues if any component of the app failed.

 2) Describe how this application can be deployed in the cloud using PaaS infrastructure.
    Paas infrastructure let you focus on your main task which creating code for the application and the rest is taken care by the cloud provider such as configurations for softwares those are needed, scaling of 
    virtual machines as per demand.
     To deploy this application using PaaS will be consist of several steps:

    1)Pick a PaaS provider:
     You will select a platform with already available application development and deployment tools.
    
    2)Deploy the Web Server:
    Just upload your Flask website to the platform. Your program will run together with the needed infrastructure autogenerated by the platform.

    3)Regarding the Database:
    The cloud offers you managed Postgres database service. Setting up these services is straightforward; you do not have to maintain the software or server. You simply link your web app to the data store.

    4)Frontend Configuration:
    For the React frontend, one could use a static hosting service like Google Cloud Storage, or even the same PaaS platform used for the backend.

    5)Auto Scaling :
    One of the greatest features of PaaS is how it automatically scales to meet fewer or more users. The platform will scale up resources without you having to manually add servers if your application draws more 
    traffic.

    6)Focus:
    Given the platform's handling of the infrastructure, you simply work on writing and maintaining your app. The platform generally offers means to easily track and analyze your app if something doesn't go as 
    planned.
