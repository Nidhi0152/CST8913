2.What questions will you ask to understand more about the company infrastructure?
-->There are several questions that I could ask they are as follow:
 1)How does your infrastructure support real-time pricing and promotion data updates at the checkout process, and what improvements are needed to meet your performance targets?
 2)What performance challenges have you faced with your existing POS system during checkout?
 3)How does your current infrastructure handle the volume and complexity of processing hundreds of thousands of checkouts daily across multiple brands?

3.Produce a RACI matrix for the migration stakeholders.

The digital chief is responsible for defining business objectives, selecting an onboarding strategy, and overseeing all activities. The IT team is responsible for managing tasks such as resource assessment, cloud migration, data entry, and demonstration support. Store managers provide information on business needs, while HR and the Training Team handle employee training. Dynamics 365 customers support the technical aspects, including data migration and testing, while the Finance Team is involved in budgeting and pricing decisions.

4.Describe the most likely migration approach that will suit the chosen company.
-->I believe Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Limited (ABFRL) is larde-size organization and for that a phased migration approach will be most appropriate. The company can begin by moving selected stores or departments to minimize risks, test the solution, and refine the process.This method provides time for training, troubleshooting, and refining the integration, ensuring a smooth transition across the entire organization.

5.Produce a high level schedule for the migration process.
-->The migration should follow a phased approach, allowing time for testing, feedback, and adjustments. First, they should assess the current system and develop a migration strategy. Then, they should implement the strategy in a few selected stores to test the new system and refine the process based on feedback. Once the pilot is successful, they should proceed with the full migration. After migration, they should closely monitor the system, provide support as needed, and make necessary optimizations based on ongoing feedback.

6.What are the main decision criteria for the chosen company?
