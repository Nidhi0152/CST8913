-->I believe Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Limited (ABFRL) is larde-size organization and for that a phased migration approach will be most appropriate. The company can begin by moving selected stores or departments to minimize risks, test the solution, and refine the process.This method provides time for training, troubleshooting, and refining the integration, ensuring a smooth transition across the entire organization.

5.Produce a high level schedule for the migration process.
-->The migration should follow a phased approach, allowing time for testing, feedback, and adjustments. First, they should assess the current system and develop a migration strategy. Then, they should implement the strategy in a few selected stores to test the new system and refine the process based on feedback. Once the pilot is successful, they should proceed with the full migration. After migration, they should closely monitor the system, provide support as needed, and make necessary optimizations based on ongoing feedback.
