# 1.Discovery and Tooling Setup for Migration to Azure

## Tools for Discovery

- **Azure Migrate**: A comprehensive tool for assessing, planning, and migrating on-premises workloads to Azure.
- **Azure Migrate: Server Assessment**: Used to assess on-premises infrastructure for migration readiness and provide sizing recommendations for Azure.
- **Azure Migrate: Server Migration**: Facilitates the migration of workloads from on-premises servers to Azure, ensuring a smooth transition.
- **Azure Migrate Appliance**: A lightweight, agentless appliance that collects data from the on-premises environment to assist in migration planning.

## Data to be Collected

- **Operating System Details**: Information about the OS version, configuration, and patch level on existing servers.
- **Software Inventory**: A list of all software components and dependencies, such as NGINX, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Redis.
- **Dependencies**: Details of inter-service communication, network configurations, and firewall rules between components.
- **Resource Utilization**: Metrics on CPU, memory, storage, and network usage for optimal Azure resource sizing.
- **Backup Strategy**: Information on the current backup system, including backup frequency and retention policies.

## Credential and Permission Management

- **Azure Active Directory (AAD)**: Used to manage user identities and control access to Azure resources and migration tools.
- **Managed Identity**: Azure service feature that enables secure authentication without storing credentials in plaintext.
- **Azure Key Vault**: Securely stores sensitive data, such as passwords and API keys, with encrypted access control.

# 2. Assessment Planning

## Assessment Parameters to Configure in Azure Migrate

- **Performance History**: Collect 30 days of performance data to assess CPU, memory, storage, and network utilization for accurate sizing.
- **Sizing Strategy**: Use Azureâ€™s VM size recommendations or manual adjustments based on collected performance metrics for optimal resource allocation.
- **Availability and Resiliency**: Consider Azure availability zones, replication, and SLAs to ensure high availability and resiliency.
- **Cost Estimation**: Generate a cost estimate based on Azure VM sizes, storage types, and regions to align with budget requirements.

## Target Azure Region, Compute Type, and Storage Type

- **Target Azure Region**: Choose a region close to the primary user base (e.g., **East US** or **West Europe**) to minimize latency and meet compliance needs.
- **Compute Type**: Select **Azure Virtual Machines** (D-series or E-series) for compute resources based on CPU and memory requirements.
- **Storage Type**: Use **Standard SSD** for general production workloads and **Premium SSD** for high-performance applications like PostgreSQL.

## Validating Assessment Results with Stakeholders

- **Review Performance and Cost Estimates**: Share the performance and cost estimates with stakeholders to ensure alignment with business goals.
- **Gather Feedback on Sizing**: Confirm that the proposed VM sizes and storage types meet performance and budget expectations.
- **Ensure Compliance Needs are Met**: Verify that the selected Azure region complies with geographic and regulatory requirements.
- **Conduct Risk Assessment**: Discuss potential risks and mitigation strategies for infrastructure changes with stakeholders.
