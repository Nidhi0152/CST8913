# 1.Discovery and Tooling Setup for Migration to Azure

## Tools for Discovery

- **Azure Migrate**: A comprehensive tool for assessing, planning, and migrating on-premises workloads to Azure.
- **Azure Migrate: Server Assessment**: Used to assess on-premises infrastructure for migration readiness and provide sizing recommendations for Azure.
- **Azure Migrate: Server Migration**: Facilitates the migration of workloads from on-premises servers to Azure, ensuring a smooth transition.
- **Azure Migrate Appliance**: A lightweight, agentless appliance that collects data from the on-premises environment to assist in migration planning.

## Data to be Collected

- **Operating System Details**: Information about the OS version, configuration, and patch level on existing servers.
- **Software Inventory**: A list of all software components and dependencies, such as NGINX, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Redis.
- **Dependencies**: Details of inter-service communication, network configurations, and firewall rules between components.
- **Resource Utilization**: Metrics on CPU, memory, storage, and network usage for optimal Azure resource sizing.
- **Backup Strategy**: Information on the current backup system, including backup frequency and retention policies.

## Credential and Permission Management

- **Azure Active Directory (AAD)**: Used to manage user identities and control access to Azure resources and migration tools.
- **Managed Identity**: Azure service feature that enables secure authentication without storing credentials in plaintext.
- **Azure Key Vault**: Securely stores sensitive data, such as passwords and API keys, with encrypted access control.

# 2. Assessment Planning

## Assessment Parameters to Configure in Azure Migrate

- **Performance History**: Collect 30 days of performance data to assess CPU, memory, storage, and network utilization for accurate sizing.
- **Sizing Strategy**: Use Azure’s VM size recommendations or manual adjustments based on collected performance metrics for optimal resource allocation.
- **Availability and Resiliency**: Consider Azure availability zones, replication, and SLAs to ensure high availability and resiliency.
- **Cost Estimation**: Generate a cost estimate based on Azure VM sizes, storage types, and regions to align with budget requirements.

## Target Azure Region, Compute Type, and Storage Type

- **Target Azure Region**: Choose a region close to the primary user base (e.g., **East US** or **West Europe**) to minimize latency and meet compliance needs.
- **Compute Type**: Select **Azure Virtual Machines** (D-series or E-series) for compute resources based on CPU and memory requirements.
- **Storage Type**: Use **Standard SSD** for general production workloads and **Premium SSD** for high-performance applications like PostgreSQL.

## Validating Assessment Results with Stakeholders

- **Review Performance and Cost Estimates**: Share the performance and cost estimates with stakeholders to ensure alignment with business goals.
- **Gather Feedback on Sizing**: Confirm that the proposed VM sizes and storage types meet performance and budget expectations.
- **Ensure Compliance Needs are Met**: Verify that the selected Azure region complies with geographic and regulatory requirements.
- **Conduct Risk Assessment**: Discuss potential risks and mitigation strategies for infrastructure changes with stakeholders.

# 3. Dependency Analysis and Optimization

## Agentless or Agent-Based Dependency Mapping in Azure Migrate

- **Agentless Dependency Mapping**: Azure Migrate's agentless discovery method will be used to map dependencies across the infrastructure by analyzing network traffic and communication patterns between the servers. This method does not require installing agents on the servers, minimizing disruption during the discovery process.
- **Agent-Based Dependency Mapping**: In cases where more granular dependency data is needed, Azure Migrate’s agent-based method can be employed. This involves installing agents on the servers to provide deeper insights into communication flows and dependencies between applications, databases, and other services.

## Cleaning Dependency Data

- **Filtering Known System Dependencies**: To clean the dependency data, we will filter out known system dependencies, such as internal monitoring tools or infrastructure services, which are not part of the core application stack. This will reduce noise in the data and ensure the focus remains on relevant application-level dependencies.
- **Manual Review**: A manual review of dependency data will be conducted, with input from technical teams, to validate and refine the dependencies identified by Azure Migrate, ensuring accuracy before migration planning.

## Key Metrics

- **Criticality**: Identify critical systems and services that must have minimal downtime during migration to avoid business impact.
- **User Base**: Evaluate the size of the user base for each service ensuring that the selected Azure resources can handle peak loads and traffic.
- **SLA**: Determine the service-level agreements for each system, especially those with stringent uptime or response time requirements, ensuring Azure resources meet or exceed these standards.
- **Backup Requirements**: Identify backup needs, such as daily backups for critical systems and ensure Azure’s backup solutions are configured to meet these requirements.
